Although it seems odd, I tend to think that multirotors and satellites are very much alike. I have built satellites, quadcopters, rovers, weather balloons and cool stuff like that. I have worked on the design and development of a few satellites (ESEO, LEO-1, HiakaSat, NEUTRON-1, GOSTE-1) and have also been an active software developer of the COSMOS project (http://cosmos-project.org/). Most of this activity has been with the Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory (http://www.hsfl.hawaii.edu/) Digest of skills: satellites, control, software Digest of skills (extended): - Satellite design and development: flight software and hardware, attitude and orbit control, on board computer, thermal design, integration and testing - Satellite operations: COSMOS project - Simulators: space flight dynamics, software and hardware test beds (air-bearing, Helmholtz generator, GPS stimulator, Star tracker stimulator, motion tracking system, sun sensor stimulator, etc.) - Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC): PID, linear and non-linear control, robust control, optimal control, Lyapunov synthesis, Extended Kalman Filtering, Particle Filters, SLAM, Markov chains, E-Guidance, among others. - Dynamic Simulators: 6DoF for Satellites and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) - Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO): structural optimization, satellite constellation optimization - Systems Engineering: full integration of mechanical and electrical subsystems - Software Development: C/C++, Python, Qt, Matlab/Simulink, OpenGL,

I think of satellites as robots that move in space but I'm also quite interested in anything that has to do with maneuverable robots (water, land, air, space). More recently I have started to work on multi-robotic missions for space (Multiagent Systems), this is now the essence of my research. Control is an important part of what I do and I deal with software as the \"blood\"​ that brings to life these amazing robots. Although it may seem odd, I tend to think that multirotors and satellites are very much alike. I have built satellites, quadcopters, rovers and weather balloons. I have worked on the design and development of a few satellites (ESEO, LEO-1, HiakaSat, NEUTRON-1, GOSTE-1) and have also been an active software developer of the COSMOS project (http://cosmos-project.org/). Digest of skills: - Satellite Attitude and Orbit Control (ADCS/AOCS) design and development: control laws, embedded software, hardware specification and integration (actuators: magnetic torque rod, reaction/momentum wheel, propulsion; sensors: star tracker, magnetometer, gyroscope, sun sensor, horizon sensor), sensor data filtering. - Developed 6DoF software simulators for flight attitude dynamics and also hardware test bed based on air-bearings stimulated by Helmholtz cage, GPS simulator, Star tracker simulator, motion tracking system, sun simulator. - Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC): PID, linear and non-linear control, robust control, optimal control, Lyapunov synthesis, Extended Kalman Filtering, Particle Filters, SLAM, Markov chains, E-Guidance, among others. - Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO): structural optimization, satellite constellation optimization - Systems Engineering: full integration of mechanical and electrical subsystems - Software Development: C/C++, Python, Qt, Matlab/Simulink, OpenGL, Assembly I have focused my research interests in small satellites for many years.

As a trained industrial engineer who has spent several years in the academic space, I am fascinated by how seemingly simple problems in my surroundings or people’s lives can be hard to model and solve. Using my theoretical practice, I seek to build multi objective optimization models for the real world issues, and find win-win strategic scenarios where managerial concepts and societal satisfaction overlap. My key interests include: - Applied Operation Research - System Analysis, Simulation and Modeling - Data Analysis - Project Management - Decision Making - Supply Chain Management and Plan The problems I care about are: - Transportation - Environment - Health Care - Service Industry As a research assistant in Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering at University at Buffalo, I work in the field of Transportation and Logistics. Using traffic theory and congestion pricing policies along with cutting-edge technology, I model a network flow optimization problem wherein both the environmental concerns and social welfare are taken into consideration. As a system analyst with Rayan EN, I cooperated with a team to analyze the company's banking structure in terms of product flow, service flow, and information flow with data acquisition and processing. I assisted modifying the banking system processes and participated in designing strategic procedures to achieve both customer satisfaction and business goals. As a project manager with Noor ICT, I reported directly to the company CEO, participated in preparing projects' development plans and to-do lists, and managed documentation among stakeholders in a secure environment. I also lead a project to design and implement a knowledge sharing tool for a broad spectrum of projects which allows for targeted monitoring, data mining, reporting and communication.

My key interests include: - Applied Operation Research - System Analysis, Simulation and Modeling - Data Analysis - Project Management - Decision Making - Supply Chain Management and Plan The problems I care about are: - Transportation - Environment - Health Care - Service Industry As a research assistant in Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering at University at Buffalo, I work in the field of Transportation and Logistics. Using traffic theory and congestion pricing policies along with cutting-edge technology, I model a network flow optimization problem wherein both the environmental concerns and social welfare are taken into consideration. As a system analyst with Rayan EN, I cooperated with a team to analyze the company's banking structure in terms of product flow, service flow, and information flow with data acquisition and processing. I assisted modifying the banking system processes and participated in designing strategic procedures to achieve both customer satisfaction and business goals. As a project manager with Noor ICT, I reported directly to the company CEO, participated in preparing projects' development plans and to-do lists, and managed documentation among stakeholders in a secure environment.

In this article we present a freely accessible web-based application (GRASP-DNA), that can be used to screen prokaryotic genomes for putative DNA-binding sites of a particular transcription factor or DNA-binding molecule. This application utilizes existing theories, such as information and statistical-mechanical theories, for the calculation of positive weight matrices generated from block aligned binding sites. Using these position weight matrices entire prokaryotic genomes are screened to identify sites that display a high level of sequence similarity to existing binding sites. This application can be used in combination with high-throughput technologies for gene expression analysis and binding site characterization to assist in the elucidation of global regulatory networks.","date":"October 2000","contributorName2Url":{"Christophe Schilling":null,"Milton H.

In this article we present a freely accessible web-based application (GRASP-DNA), that can be used to screen prokaryotic genomes for putative DNA-binding sites of a particular transcription factor or DNA-binding molecule. This application utilizes existing theories, such as information and statistical-mechanical theories, for the calculation of positive weight matrices generated from block aligned binding sites. Using these position weight matrices entire prokaryotic genomes are screened to identify sites that display a high level of sequence similarity to existing binding sites. This application can be used in combination with high-throughput technologies for gene expression analysis and binding site characterization to assist in the elucidation of global regulatory networks.","date":"October 2000","contributorName2Url":{"Christophe Schilling":null,"Milton H.

spin resonance in Fe-based superconductors","description":"The spin resonance observed in the inelastic neutron scattering data on Fe-based superconductors has played a prominent role in the quest for determining the symmetry of the order parameter in these compounds. Most theoretical studies of the resonance employ an RPA-type approach in the particle-hole channel and associate the resonance in the spin susceptibility χS(q,ω) at momentum Q=(π,π) with the spin-exciton of an s+− superconductor, pulled below 2Δ by residual attraction associated with the sign change of the gap between Fermi points connected by Q. Here we explore the effect of fluctuations in the particle-particle channel on the spin resonance. Particle-particle and particle-hole channels are coupled in a superconductor and to what extent the spin resonance can be viewed as a particle-hole exciton needs to be addressed. In the case of purely repulsive interactions, we find that the particle-particle channel at total momentum Q (the π channel) contributes little to the resonance. However, if the interband density-density interaction is attractive and the π resonance is possible on its own, along with spin-exciton, we find a much stronger shift of the resonance frequency from the position of the would-be spin-exciton resonance. We also show that the expected double-peak structure in this situation does not appear because of the strong coupling between particle-hole and particle-particle channels, and ImχS(Q,ω) displays only a single peak.","date":"September 2014","contributorName2Url":{"Alberto Hinojosa Alvarado":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-hinojosa-alvarado-b50aa137","Peter Woelfle":null,"Andrey Chubukov":null},"source":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-hinojosa-alvarado-b50aa137"},{"name":"Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking Superconductivity in the Coexistence Phase with Magnetism in Fe Pnictides","description":"We argue that superconductivity in the coexistence region with spin-density-wave (SDW) order in weakly doped Fe pnictides erdiffers qualitatively from the ordinary s+− state outside the coexistence region as it develops an additional gap component which is a mixture of intrapocket singlet (s++) and interpocket spin-triplet pairings (the t state). The coupling constant for the t channel is proportional to the SDW order and involves interactions that do not contribute to superconductivity outside of the SDW region. We argue that the s+−- and t-type superconducting orders coexist at low temperatures, and the relative phase between the two is, in general, different from 0 or π, manifesting explicitly the breaking of the time-reversal symmetry promoted by long-range SDW order. We argue that time reversal may get broken even before true superconductivity develops.","date":null,"contributorName2Url":{"Alberto Hinojosa Alvarado":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-hinojosa-alvarado-b50aa137","Rafael Fernandes":null,"Andrey Chubukov":null},"source":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-hinojosa-alvarado-b50aa137"},{"name":"Gap structure in Fe-based superconductors with accidental nodes: The role of hybridization","description":"We study the effects of hybridization between the two electron pockets in Fe-based superconductors with s-wave gap with accidental nodes. We argue that hybridization reconstructs the Fermi surfaces and also induces an additional interpocket pairing component. We analyze how these two effects modify the gap structure by tracing the position of the nodal points of the energy dispersions in the superconducting state. We find three possible outcomes. In the first, the nodes simply shift their positions in the Brillouin zone; in the second, the nodes merge and disappear, in which case the gap function has either equal or opposite signs on the electron pockets; in the third, a new set of nodal points emerges, doubling the original number of nodes.","date":"June 2015","contributorName2Url":{"Alberto Hinojosa Alvarado":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-hinojosa-alvarado-b50aa137","Andrey Chubukov":null},"source":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-hinojosa-alvarado-b50aa137"}],"appRatingByCategory":{},"short":false,"profileTypeRaw":1,"private":false,"new":null},"up1":{"docId":739336059740222,"permIds":[],"donorDocIds":[739336059740222],"donorProfileTypes":[1],"profilesIds":[],"organization":false,"empty":false,"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"name":"Alberto Hinojosa Alvarado","title":null,"workHours":null,"downloadTime":1457506796007,"positions":[{"companyName":"University of Minnesota","rawCompanyName":"University of Minnesota","companyWebsite":null,"companyId":null,"position":"Graduate Student and Teaching Assistant","description":"- Performed analytic and numerical calculations to study theoretical aspects of the iron-based high-temperature superconductors, including the modeling and interpretation of experimental results and the prediction of new phenomena based on established models. - Designed 2D and 3D diagrams for use in technical papers and presentations. - Presented research results in written form in scientific journals and as talks and posters at conferences, workshops, and seminars. - Collaborated with main advisor, professors from other universities, and other students. - Mentored a new research group member.

spin resonance in Fe-based superconductors","description":"The spin resonance observed in the inelastic neutron scattering data on Fe-based superconductors has played a prominent role in the quest for determining the symmetry of the order parameter in these compounds. Most theoretical studies of the resonance employ an RPA-type approach in the particle-hole channel and associate the resonance in the spin susceptibility χS(q,ω) at momentum Q=(π,π) with the spin-exciton of an s+− superconductor, pulled below 2Δ by residual attraction associated with the sign change of the gap between Fermi points connected by Q. Here we explore the effect of fluctuations in the particle-particle channel on the spin resonance. Particle-particle and particle-hole channels are coupled in a superconductor and to what extent the spin resonance can be viewed as a particle-hole exciton needs to be addressed. In the case of purely repulsive interactions, we find that the particle-particle channel at total momentum Q (the π channel) contributes little to the resonance. However, if the interband density-density interaction is attractive and the π resonance is possible on its own, along with spin-exciton, we find a much stronger shift of the resonance frequency from the position of the would-be spin-exciton resonance. We also show that the expected double-peak structure in this situation does not appear because of the strong coupling between particle-hole and particle-particle channels, and ImχS(Q,ω) displays only a single peak.","date":"September 2014","contributorName2Url":{"Alberto Hinojosa Alvarado":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-hinojosa-alvarado-b50aa137","Peter Woelfle":null,"Andrey Chubukov":null},"source":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-hinojosa-alvarado-b50aa137"},{"name":"Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking Superconductivity in the Coexistence Phase with Magnetism in Fe Pnictides","description":"We argue that superconductivity in the coexistence region with spin-density-wave (SDW) order in weakly doped Fe pnictides erdiffers qualitatively from the ordinary s+− state outside the coexistence region as it develops an additional gap component which is a mixture of intrapocket singlet (s++) and interpocket spin-triplet pairings (the t state). The coupling constant for the t channel is proportional to the SDW order and involves interactions that do not contribute to superconductivity outside of the SDW region. We argue that the s+−- and t-type superconducting orders coexist at low temperatures, and the relative phase between the two is, in general, different from 0 or π, manifesting explicitly the breaking of the time-reversal symmetry promoted by long-range SDW order.
